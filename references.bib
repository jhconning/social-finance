  abstract = {This paper is a survey of the literature on boards of directors, with an emphasis on research done subsequent to the Benjamin E. Hermalin and Michael S. Weisbach (2003) survey. The two questions most asked about boards are what determines their makeup and what determines their actions? These questions are fundamentally intertwined, which complicates the study of boards because makeup and actions are jointly endogenous. A focus of this survey is how the literature, theoretical as well as empirical, deals--or on occasions fails to deal--with this complication. We suggest that many studies of boards can best be interpreted as joint statements about both the director-selection process and the effect of board composition on board actions and firm performance.},

When market insurance is provided, supplementary mutual assistance between family and friends (unobservable to market insurers) will occur. When nonmarket insurers have no better information than market insurers, the mutual assistance not only crowds out market insurance, but is also harmful and, therefore, dysfunctional. Alternatively, when nonmarket insurers can observe each other's effort perfectly, mutual assistance is beneficial. These results point to the potential importance of peer-monitoring mechanisms in mitigating moral hazard.},

Credit protection insulates lenders against losses when liquidating non--performing borrowers' projects. This hardens borrowers' budget constraints, which can have positive implications for incentives. However, credit risk transfer also dilutes the joint surplus of the bank-borrower coalition, thereby making it less worthwhile to implement high effort. The tradeoff between the costs and benefits of risk transfer has implications for the optimal design of credit protection vehicles.

State support can raise welfare by relaxing financial constraints, but it can also reduce lending standards if entrepreneurs substitute public sources of collateral for their own assets, if it encourages excessive entrepreneurial entry, or if it undermines bank monitoring incentives. We derive a "pecking order" for support schemes: support funds should be channeled first to credit guarantee schemes and then, when entrepreneurs start to substitute public for private collateral, to co-funding entrepreneurial projects. The optimal level of credit guarantee is diminishing in the costs of incentivising bank monitoring. We show in an extension that the long-term effect of public subsidies may be to impair the private sector's initiative to uncover cost savings.},

  abstract = {We begin the Paper by laying out a simple methodology that allows us to determine whether firms are credit constrained, based on how they react to changes in directed lending programs. The basic idea is that while both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We then apply this methodology to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000. Using firms that were already getting this kind of credit before 1998, and retained eligibility in 2000 to control for time trends, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead the credit was used to finance more production - there was significant acceleration in the rate of growth of sales and profits for these firms. We conclude that many of the firms must have been severely credit constrained.}

  abstract = {Self-regulation is the private provision of public goods and private redistribution. This paper examines the scope of self-regulation motivated by altruistic moral preferences that are reciprocal and stronger the closer are citizens in a socioeconomic distance. The focus is on the role of organizations in increasing self-regulation by mitigating free-rider problems. Social label and certification organizations can expand the scope of self-regulation but not beyond that with unconditional altruism. Enforcement organizations expand the scope of self-regulation farther, and for-profit enforcement is more aggressive than nonprofit enforcement. Enforcement through social pressure imposed by NGOs also expands the scope of self-regulation. (JEL D64, H41, L51)},

We show that a segmented labor market characterized by tied-labor contracts and involuntary unemployment in the lean season are optimal as compared to a labor hiring arrangement that guarantees full employment of labor in both seasons. Government intervention in the form of a specific subsidy targeted toward the hiring of permanent laborers may raise the welfare of all laborers while a specific subsidy directed toward the hiring of casual laborers or the institution of relief programs that absorb the rural unemployed in the lean season leads to the casual laborers in the economy being worse off.},

Lack of access to finance is often the critical mechanism for generating persistent income inequality, as well as slower economic growth. Hence expanding access remains an important challenge across the world, leaving much for governments to do. However, not all government actions are equally effective and some policies can even be counterproductive. This paper sets out principles for effective government policy on broadening access, drawing on the available evidence and illustrating with examples. The paper concludes with directions for future research.},

We construct four measures and apply them to data on virtually all U. S. banks from 1993 to 2003. We find that bank liquidity creation increased every year and exceeded \$2.8 trillion in 2003. Large banks, multibank holding company members, retail banks, and recently merged banks created the most liquidity. Bank liquidity creation is positively correlated with bank value. Testing recent theories of the relationship between capital and liquidity creation, we find that the relationship is positive for large banks and negative for small banks.}

High agency costs in turn lead to low and inefficient investment. Standard policies for fighting financial fragility can be interpreted as transfers that maintain or increase the net worth of potential borrowers.},

This type of scheme, especially in the guise of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, has received increasing attention. We set up and analyze the 'repayment game' which group lending gives rise to. Our analysis suggests that such schemes have both positive and negative effects on repayment rates. The positive effect is that successful group members may have an incentive to repay the loans of group members whose projects have yielded insufficient return to make repayment worthwhile. The negative effect arises when the whole group defaults, even when some members would have repaid under individual lending. We also show how group lending may harness social collateral, which serves to mitigate its negative effect.}

Indeed, firms that use CSR will produce public goods at exactly the same level as predicted by the standard voluntary contribution equilibrium for public goods. We compare CSR with government provision and charitable provision, discussing when CSR by private for-profit firms could have a comparative advantage in dealing with public goods provision.},

Banks' optimal asset/liability policy is such that in equilibrium capital adequacy constraints are always binding. Asymmetric information about banks' net worth adds a cost to outside equity capital, which limits the extent to which banks can relax their capital constraint. In this context monetary policy does not affect bank lending through changes in bank liquidity. Rather, it has the effect of changing the aggregate composition of financing by firms. The model also produces multiple equilibria, one of which displays all the features of a "credit crunch". Thus, monetary policy can also have large effects when it induces a},

The relationship banking aspect of financial intermediation is emphasized: firms turn to banks as a source of investment mainly because banks are good at helping them through times of financial distress. This financial flexibility is costly since banks face costs of capital themselves (which they attempt to minimize through securitization). To avoid this intermediation cost, firms may turn to bond or equity financing, but bonds imply an inefficient liquidation cost and equity an informational dilution cost. We show that in equilibrium the riskier firms prefer bank loans, the safer ones tap the bond markets, and the ones in between prefer to issue both equity and bonds.

The paper emphasizes the relationship Banking aspect of financial intermediation: firms turn to banks as a source of investment mainly because banks are good at helping them through times of financial distress. The debt restructuring service that banks may offer, however, is costly. Therefore, the firms which do not expect to be financially distressed prefer to obtain a cheaper market source of funding through bond or equity issues. This explains why bank lending and bond financing may co-exist in equilibrium. The reason why firms or banks also issue equity in our model is simply to avoid bankruptcy. Banks have the additional motive that they need to satisfy minimum capital adequacy requeriments. Several types of equilibria are possible, one of which has all the main characteristics of a "credit crunch". This multiplicity implies that the channels of monetary policy may depend on the type of equilibrium that prevails, leading sometimes to support a "credit view" and other times the classical "money view".},

  abstract = {This paper undertakes a simple general equilibrium analysis of the consequences of deposit insurance programs, the way in which they are priced, and the way in which they fund revenue shortfalls. In our economy, the central issue in analyzing deposit insurance is how the government will make up any FDIC losses. Deposit insurance premia matter only in so far as they affect the level of implied FDIC revenue shortfalls. Moreover, local variations in the magnitude of FDIC losses will generically be irrelevant for the determination of any equilibrium quantities that affect agent welfare. However, large enough changes in these losses can "matter". There is no presumption that keeping these shortfalls low is a "good idea". Finally, we show that multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria can be observed. The potential for multiplicity of equilibria may depend on components of FDIC policy. Our analysis provides counterexamples to the following propositions. (1) Actuarially fair pricing of deposit insurance is always desirable. (2) Implicit FDIC subsidization of banks through deposit insurance is always undesirable. (3) "Large" FDIC losses are necessarily symptomatic of a poorly designed deposit insurance system. (4) Risk-based deposit insurance premia can easily be used to reduce moral hazard problems associated with deposit insurance provision.}

In states where taxpayers pay for the costs of resolving insolvencies, life insurers hold portfolios with higher overall stock market risk and higher levels of risky assets.

Airmen job performance and retention declines with payday loan access, and severely poor readiness increases. These effects are strongest among relatively inexperienced and financially unsophisticated airmen.},

  abstract = {There has been a substantial recent growth in government loan guarantees to ailing firms in the United States. This paper investigates the potential incentive effects of this practice. Using the simplest available two-period model, it is shown that when firms know that loan guarantees may be forthcoming, they may be induced to adopt riskier investments and take on more leverage. These perverse incentive effects imply that the actual loan-guarantees-related contingent liability of the government could be much larger than suspected. Our policy recommendation is that the government either abandon the practice altogether or set up a federal agency that sells loan guarantees to all firms at prices that depend on the riskiness of the firm's assets and its leverage.}

This static assumption is not only unrealistic, but the resulting predictions appear to be at odds with many work organizations.

The optimal incentive scheme is shown to display observed features of the increasingly popular "teams," such as the use of low-powered, group incentives.}

The joint liability feature associated with group lending lowers the liquidity risk of default but creates a free-riding problem. In the static setting, the free-riding problem dominates the liquidity risk effect under a plausible condition, thus making group lending unattractive. When the projects are repeated infinitely many times, however, the joint liability feature provides the group members with a credible means of exercising peer sanction, which can make the group lending attractive, relative to individual lending.}

It demonstrates that, if the amount of collateral pledged in a loan contract exceeds a critical value, the borrower's project may be inefficiently liquidated once he becomes financially distressed. It also shows that a fairly priced loan guarantee provided by a third party can partially alleviate this inefficient liquidation problem. This paper predicts that riskier borrowers will pledge more collateral, which is consistent with the empirical findings of Berger and Udell [Berger, A. N., \& Udell, G. F. (1990).

When the project is financed with external capital, the owner may have an incentive to under or over invest in social good.  Under investment arises when the owner does not fully internalize the social value of the public good.  Over investment arises because repayment uses up only the private good, making the social good relatively more attractive.  The model provides a theoretical foundation for funding impact investments through Social Impact Bonds - to discourage over investment - or Social Impact Guarantees - to discourage under investment.  When social investors have sufficient capital, socially responsible investment strategies such as equity investments in socially responsible firms are also optimal.},

A model of financial intermediation with moral hazard in the use of borrowed funds and in loan monitoring activities by delegates or peer-monitors predicts how a variety of different contracting strategies to lower  collateral requirements and increase loan sizes will be adapted to different target borrower groups.  Tradeoffs between  outreach, sustainability and financial leverage within these lending relationships are shaped by the monitoring and delegation costs that endogenously emerge within the chain of agency relationships established between borrowers and   loan-monitoring staff, staff and MFO owners, and between owners and outside investors and guarantors. All else equal, sustainable MFOs which target a poorer population of borrowers must charge higher interest rates, will employ more high-powered staff incentives, will have higher staff costs per dollar loaned, and will be able to leverage less of their equity. The models predictions are broadly supported by an analysis of evidence from 72 microfinance lending  programs from around the world and by evidence from the market for small business loans in the United States.},

We revisit this issue by evaluating changes in low-income mortgage lending at commercial banks over the 1992-96 period. Our empirical results fail to support a hypothesis that banks respond to public and regulatory pressure exerted as a result of a downgrade in CRA rating by increasing low-income mortgage lending. The findings are consistent with the contention that during this period regulators stressed adjustments in the lending process of banks (e.g., documentation of lending program and efforts directed at targeted markets) more than lending performance. The findings underscore the importance of regulatory efforts made later in the decade to more closely link enforcement of the CRA to lending outcomes.},

Incentives are impaired by the agency pursuing multiple missions. A lack of focus is even more problematic in the case of fuzzy missions, that is when outsiders are uncertain about the exact nature of the missions actually pursued by the agency. Consequently, agencies pursuing multiple missions receive less autonomy. The paper further shows that professionalization creates a sense of mission for the agency and that the specialization of officials raises their incentives. Last, the paper compares its predictions with the stylized facts on government bureaucracies.},

The impact of information provides a major distinction between the explicit and implicit incentives model.

Moreover, the extent to which managers engage in risk-taking may depend on how well their interests are aligned with those of the owners.

Next, we claim that the attitude of the “second” Rawls about it is rather ambiguous and vacillates between exclusion and inclusion. We attempt to prove that thanks to the concepts Rawls has developed from 1985 onwards (especially the concept of public reason), he could have resorted to the concept of merit goods to cope better with his new objectives.},

For-profit retail banks may offer a superior bundle of financial services, but not-for-profit (occupational) credit unions enjoy sponsor subsidies that allow them to capture a share of the local market. The model predicts that greater participation in credit unions in a given county will be associated with higher levels of retail-bank concentration. We find empirical evidence of this association. The ability of credit unions to affect local banking market structure supports the presumption of current banking antitrust analysis that retail banking markets remain local. We identify local economic factors that modulate the nature of competition between banks and credit unions, including income per capita and population density.},

It examines the impact of the transformation process upon a control group of approximately 25 MFIs that Women’s World Banking has been tracking since 2000. The paper finds that transformation: Results in increased client outreach and accelerated growth in total loan portfolio; Results in product diversification—particularly with respect to the mobilization of client savings; Tends to result in higher average loan sizes for RFIs than NGO MFIs; Allows MFIs to serve more women clients, but the percentage of women clients being served declines. Further, it lists out experiences of microfinance practitioners with the transformation process across following aspects: Maintaining the mission post-transformation; Staying committed to women, while managing growth through transformation; Focus on women clients and resources. The paper concludes that transformation is a central component of the commercialization trend in microfinance. However, the industry needs to remain alert to the potential for mission drift, and ensure that the movement towards larger and more profitable loans does not come at the expense of low-income entrepreneurs that have formed the core of the industry.}

We show that joint-liability lending contracts, similar to those used by credit cooperatives and group-lending schemes, will induce endogenous peer selection in the formation of groups in a way that the instrument of joint liability can be used as a screening device to exploit this local information. This can improve welfare and repayment rates if standard screening instruments such as collateral are unavailable.}

We show that if firms had to compete for motivated workers then not-for-profit firms would be competed out by for-profit firms. Therefore, in the choice between not-for-profit and for-profit provision, other than incentive problems, the distribution of rents between management and workers, and consequently, the relative scarcity of motivated workers may play an important role.},

Firms that advertise their social and environmental good works in effect solicit charitable contributions from customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. They compete with not-for-profits in the market to supply public and altruistic goods. To analyze how corporate altruism affects firm valuations, a model is developed in which investors gain utility both from personal consumption and from making donations to worthy causes. A share in a "responsible" firm is a charity-investment bundle. When individuals view corporations and not-for-profits as equally competent suppliers of charity-related "warm glow," small changes in firms' social policies induce exactly offsetting changes in individuals' portfolio choices. There is no effect on firm valuations, and no change in the aggregate supply of good works. When a sizable fraction of investors prefer corporate philanthropy over direct charitable giving (e.g., to avoid taxation of corporate profits), firm valuations will be maximized by following social policies that involve strictly positive levels of corporate altruism.},

One general explanation for the success of credit cooperatives emphasizes their ability to capitalize on superior information and to impose inexpensive but effective sanctions on defaulters. These features supposedly permit cooperatives to lend to individuals whom banks would spurn, and to tailor loan terms more closely to borrowers' needs. I use the business records of several German credit cooperatives to test this claim. The results show that real efficiency advantages are at least part of the explanation for their success.}

Offers a general theory of enterprise ownership and explores the role played by particular forms of ownership in particular industries. Addresses producer-owned enterprise, considering investor-owned firms; the benefits and costs of employee ownership; governing employee-owned firms; and agricultural and other producer cooperatives. Examines customer-owned enterprise, including retail, wholesale, and supply firms; utilities; clubs and other associative organizations; and housing cooperatives and condominiums within the housing sector. Explores nonprofit firms and mutual enterprise, including banks and insurance companies. Suggests that each type of ownership has its appropriate niche in the economy and that the relative efficiency of alternative forms of ownership in any given industry is determined by the costs of market contracting and the costs of ownership that confront the industry's consumers and suppliers.

CSR is defined as a programme of actions to reduce externalized costs or to avoid distributional conflicts. It has evolved in response to market failures, a Coasian solution to problems associated with social costs. The analysis suggests that there is a resource-allocation role for CSR programmes in cases of market failure through private-social cost differentials, and also where distributional disagreements are strong. In some sectors of the economy private and social costs are roughly in line and distributional debates are unusual: here CSR has little role to play. Such sectors are outnumbered by those where CSR can play a valuable role in ensuring that the invisible hand acts, as intended, to produce the social good. It can also act to improve corporate profits and guard against reputational risks.},

In a model of quality provision, we find a clear ranking of quality produced: Firms provide lowest and nonprofits highest levels of quality. Efficiency, however, depends on the competitive environment, the decision making process and technology. Cooperatives are optimal when decision making costs are low. Else, cooperatives are increasingly dominated by either nonprofits or firms (depending on the incremental costs of quality production). Finally, changes in the competitive environment affect organizational choice: Increased competition induces a shift towards firm organization and away from nonprofits.},

The authors prove that simple redistributive policies can yield Pareto improvements and increase aggregate income. Indeed, redistributive policies are, under most circumstances, more effective in increasing efficiency than corrective taxes or subsidies where higher education is beyond the reach of the poor.},

Side contracts enable agents to cooperate more effectively, provided they share information the principal does not have. Cooperation is useful when there is a need to coordinate decisions. Also, it enables the principal to rely on group incentives in which agents monitor each other. However, cooperation makes activities more substitutable and introduces arbitrage opportunities that are costly. Ideally, the principal would like to encourage cooperation in some dimensions and competition in others. It is shown that restricting monetary side payments can be effective in achieving a balance.}

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of commercialization on capital structure, mission and performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach – Robust estimation techniques ranging from simple OLS to fixed and random effects, Tobit and two-stage least-squares regression were applied using panel data for six-year period 2003-2008. Findings – The authors' results are generally robust and indicate that leverage decreases the relative level of outreach to the very poor. This is expected as increases in cost of capital leads to higher cost of borrowing, higher default rate and increased risk. Increased use of commercial debt and equity financing lowers productivity for client-maximizing MFIs through lower conversion of savers to borrowers or the yield rate. Research limitations/implications – Analysis was done with six years of data as some of the disclosures by MFIs were missing. As comprehensive disclosures become available, a similar study can be performed to see whether degrees of freedom affected the result. However, the research results support the expected outcome and the expectations of leading practitioners. Practical implications – The study suggests that MFIs can adopt a non-commercial approach to financing as an alternative to commercialization. Such models are available in practice. Social implications – Findings suggest that mission drift experienced by MFIs due to commercialization is a wrong turn for the industry. Originality/value – The paper describes the first study of its kind in the microfinance sector that used comprehensive estimation techniques with traditional and new performance variables.}

The key innovation is that the investment contract is subject to statutory liability limits. Given these liability limits two settings are considered, one in which the investor payoff function is also constrained to be monotonically nondecreasing in firm profit, and another in which no such "monotonic contract" constraint is imposed. In the former case, a standard debt contract is shown to emerge and a "first best" effort choice is not achieved. In the latter setting, the optimum is characterized by a "live-or-die" payoff function, and a "first best" effort level may or may not be realized.}

When identified nuisance parameters are absent under the null, we show that MC p-values are finite sample, level-exact. To illustrate this easy-to-implement approach, we analyze the spot prices of four commodities (aluminium, copper, gold and lead) and the closing prices of four technology stocks (Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Sun).

  abstract = {Bill Gates is more than the world's most successful capitalist; he's also the world's biggest philanthropist. Gates has approached philanthropy the same way he revolutionized computer software: with a fierce ambition to change the rules of the game. That's why at the 2008 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gates advocated a creative capitalism in which big corporations, the distinguishing feature of the modern global economy, integrate doing good into their way of doing business. This controversial new idea is discussed and debated by the more than forty contributors to this book, among them three Nobel laureates and two former U.S. cabinet secretaries. Edited by author and columnist Michael Kinsley, the book started as a first-of-its-kind online conversation that brought together some of the world's best minds to engage Gates's challenge. From Warren Buffett, who seconds Gates's analysis, to Lawrence Summers, who worries about the consequences of multiple corporate objectives, the essays cover a broad spectrum of opinion.--From publisher description.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that worker cooperatives are prone to redistribution among members, and that this redistribution distorts incentives. I assume that employment contracts are incomplete. In the model cooperative members pay in a capital contribution to purchase equipment. They then receive shocks to ability. Each worker's (observable) output depends on ability and on effort, neither of which can be observed separately. After ability is realized, members vote on a wage schedule as a function of output. If the median member has less than average ability, the cooperative will vote for a redistributive schedule, dulling incentives. Whereas workers in firms owned by outside shareholders would quit if the firm redistributed away from them, cooperative members will be reluctant to leave, since this entails forfeiting the dividends on their capital contribution. The model can explain why cooperatives typically have egalitarian wage policies.},

Design/methodology/approach- Panel data covering the ten-year period 1995-2004 were analyzed within the framework of fixed- and random-effects techniques. Findings--Most of the microfinance institutions employ high leverage and finance their operations with long-term as against short-term debt. Also, highly leveraged microfinance institutions perform better by reaching out to more clientele, enjoy scale economies, and therefore are better able to deal with moral hazard and adverse selection, enhancing their ability to deal with risk. Originality/value--This is the first study of its kind in the sector, especially within sub-Saharan Africa.}

In their model, with no limits on communication between the agents and the principal (complete contracting), collusion is not an issue in a centralized organization. Centralization always dominates (at least weakly) delegation. With limits on communication (incomplete contracting), collusion may have some bite under centralization. Limits on communication introduce an anonymity condition on the contract, creating a conflict between participation and coalition incentive constraints under centralization. By shifting the bargaining power in the side-contracting stage, delegation is nonanonymous and asymmetric by design. This conflict is then avoided or diminished depending on the exact t! iming of the delegation game.},

Group lending contracts are shown to be dominated by revelation mechanisms which do not use the ex post observability of the partners' performances. However, when collusion between borrowers under complete information is allowed, group lending contracts are optimal in the class of simple revelation mechanisms (which elicit only the borrower's own private information) and remain useful with extended revelation mechanisms.}

We attempt to explain these observations by adding limited commitment as an impediment to risk-pooling. We provide a general dynamic model and completely characterise efficient informal insurance arrangements constrained by limited commitment, and test the model using data from three Indian villages. We find that the model can fully explain the dynamic response of consumption to income, but that it fails to explain the distribution of consumption across households.}

  abstract = {This paper reviews the achievements of the "microfinance revolution", through reference to the now extensive literature. It finds that there are many opportunities to improve and innovate. To illustrate this finding, the paper concentrates on examining what we need to know to design and deliver better financial products to the poor, especially the poorest. It argues that financial services for the poor are essentially a matter of helping the poor turn their savings into sums large enough to satisfy a wide range of business, consumption, personal, social and asset-building needs. The range of such "swaps" should be wide enough to cater for short, medium and long-term needs, and they must be delivered in ways which are convenient, appropriate, safe and affordable. Providing poor people with effective financial services helps them deal with vulnerability and can thereby help reduce poverty. However, the relationship is driven by complex livelihood imperatives and is not simple. Microfinance is not a magic sky-hook that reaches down to pluck the poor out of poverty. It can, however, be a strategically vital platform that the poor can use to raise their own prospects for an escape from poverty.},

  abstract = {Using geographic differences in the availability of payday loans, I estimate the real effects of credit access among low-income households. Payday loans are small, high interest rate loans that constitute the marginal source of credit for many high risk borrowers. I find no evidence that payday loans alleviate economic hardship. To the contrary, loan access leads to increased difficulty paying mortgage, rent and utilities bills. The empirical design isolates variation in loan access that is uninfluenced by lenders' location decisions and state regulatory decisions, two factors that might otherwise correlate with economic hardship measures. Further analysis of differences in loan availability—over time and across income groups—rules out a number of alternative explanations for the estimated effects. Counter to the view that improving credit access facilitates important expenditures, the results suggest that for some low-income households the debt service burden imposed by borrowing inhibits their ability to pay important bills.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the theory of the voluntary public and private redistribution of wealth elaborated by economic analysis in the last forty years or so. The central object of the theory is altruistic gift-giving, construed as benevolent voluntary redistribution of income or wealth. The theory concentrates on lump-sum voluntary transfers, individual or collective, which aim at equalizing the distribution of wealth from altruistic reasons or sentiments (perfectly substitutable altruistic transfers). It implies: (i) the Pareto-inefficiency of the non-cooperative interaction of individual altruistic transfers; (ii) the neutralization of public transfers by individual altruistic transfers; (iii) and the crowding out of private altruistic transfers by Pareto-efficient public redistribution. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an informal overview of the general intent and content of the theory. Section 3 gives a first formal version of the theory in a one-commodity setup (pure distributive social system). Non-cooperative distributive equilibrium is characterized, and its fundamental properties of existence and determinacy are analyzed. Section 4 extends the definitions and fundamental properties of pure distributive social systems to general social systems that combine competitive market exchange with the non-cooperative altruistic transfers of individuals endowed with non-paternalistic interdependent preferences. Section 5 states the neutrality property in two versions of the theory successively: the general social systems of Section 4; and the important special case of the pure distributive social systems of Section 3, where the set of agents is partitioned in two subsets, namely, a subset of "poor" individuals with zero endowments and egoistic preferences, and a subset of "rich" individuals altruistic to the poor and indifferent to each other. Section 6 reviews the theory of Pareto-efficient redistribution in pure distributive social systems. Section 7 returns to the fundamental assumption of perfect substitutability of transfers through a selective review of theoretical models of imperfectly substitutable transfers and empirical tests of perfect substitutability.},

Examples are guarantees by a parent company of loans made to its subsidiaries or government guarantees of loans made to private corporations. Also included would be guarantees of bank deposits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As with other forms of insurance, the issuing of a guarantee imposes a liability or cost on the guarantor. In this paper, a formula is derived to evaluate this cost. The method used is to demonstrate an isomorphic correspondence between loan guarantees and common stock put options, and then to use the well developed theory of option pricing to derive the formula.}

Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.}

  abstract = {This article examines the economics of financing small business in private equity and debt markets. Firms are viewed through a financial growth cycle paradigm in which different capital structures are optimal at different points in the cycle. We show the sources of small business finance, and how capital structure varies with firm size and age. The interconnectedness of small firm finance is discussed along with the impact of the macroeconomic environment. We also analyze a number of research and policy issues, review the literature, and suggest topics for future research.}

Two lenders stand out: the pioneer BancoSol, which first profitably expanded the loan market with group liability loans, and the later entrant Caja Los Andes, which offered individual liability loans using costlier screening. Using a simple model of credit market competition with moral hazard and adverse selection we analyse how the terms of loan contracts were adapted to changes in competition and how borrowers' incentive to remain diligent and repay loans was affected. Hypothesized behaviour derived from the model is tested and shown to be consistent with empirical evidence from loan records and a household survey.}

Systematic study of supply, demand, price and transport characteristics of aggregate identified relevant modelling parameters and generated corresponding submodels. The supply model is based on production data segmented by labour inputs. Demand estimates overall consumption on the basis of per capita output and interest rates. Price depends mainly on geological availability and on average annual per capita income. Distribution is the least cost way of balancing production and consumption, given the constraints imposed by transport costs. The model developed is used to simulate different situations with its outputs illustrating its versatility and possibilities. The examples presented concern the price isoquants for coarse aggregate in 1987, price increase isoquants for 1987-92, the impact of foreign sources of aggregate and sensitivity to changes in transport costs.},

To analyse this, we study a mechanism design problem where borrowers share information about each other, but their limited side contracting ability prevents them from writing complete insurance contracts. We derive a lending mechanism which efficiently induces mutual insurance. It is necessary for borrowers to submit reports about each other to achieve efficiency. Such cross-reporting increases the bargaining power of unsuccessful borrowers, and is robust to collusion against the bank.}

  abstract = {Governments of most countries seek to encourage Small and Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) growth and the job creation that many believe is fostered by such growth. Substantive growth usually requires expansion capital. It is often perceived that compared with larger firms, SMEs face disproportionately less access to the debt capital they need for start-up, growth, and survival. Consequently, governments and trade associations have often intervened in credit markets by taking on the role of guarantor of loans that financial institutions advance to SMEs. For example, the Small Business Administration in the United States provides guarantees of loans made by banks to qualifying small firms. Similar schemes are in effect in, among other countries, Canada, Japan, the U.K., Korea, and Germany. Trade associations take on such roles in France, Spain, and other nations. Loans that support the expansion of small enterprises may convey significant benefits to the borrowing firms and, through job creation and retention, to the rest of society. However, to the extent that some borrowers are unable to meet the repayment obligations of their debt, guarantors also face material real costs of honoring their guarantee to the lenders. Loan guarantee programs are designed in a variety of ways. Often these programs do not appear to reflect guidance from economic theory or experience. This paper draws on empirical evidence to compare costs with benefits. In addition, it uses the results and economic theory to provide some guidance for the design of loan guarantee programs. Finally, the study shows that loan guarantee programs can be an effective means of supporting start-up, growth, and survival of new and risky enterprises. The work finds that substantial total and incremental job creation may be attributed to the Canadian loan guarantee program. The paper reviews previous attempts to conduct cost-benefit analyses of loan guarantee programs. It finds wide variation, internationally, in default rates. Published data suggests default rates vary from less than 5\% (Germany) to more than 40\% (U.K.). The empirical analysis reported here focuses on the Canadian implementation of loan guarantees, the Small Business Loans Act (SBLA). Findings include (1) loan guarantees granted under the terms of the SBLA provide an extremely efficient means of job creation, with very low estimated costs per job; (2) default rates are higher for newer firms, increase with the amount of funds borrowed, and vary widely by sector (borrowers in the retail and accommodation, and food and beverage sectors were significantly more likely to default than borrowers in other sectors); and (3) the widening eligibility to larger firms and to larger loans may not be well advised and is inconsistent with the goals of the program. Moreover, reducing the loan ceiling would arguably discourage fraudulent applications while servicing those SMEs most in need of early-stage capital. In addition, analysis of the lenders' motives suggests that default rates on the portfolio of guaranteed loans and, therefore, the costs of honoring guarantees, are particularly sensitive to the level of the guarantee. Small reductions in the level of the guarantee (for example, guaranteeing 80\% of principal and accrued interest instead of 85\%) could lead to substantial reductions in default rates. Debate persists in economic theory about whether or not government intervention in the credit market is warranted, in spite of the findings that loan guarantees seem to make positive contributions. Further analysis of these issues is advised.}

One partial solution is peer monitoring: having neighbors who are in a good position to monitor the borrower be required to pay a penalty if the borrower goes bankrupt. Peer monitoring is largely responsible for the successful financial performance of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh and of similar group lending programs elsewhere. But peer monitoring has a cost. It transfers risk from the bank, which is in a better position to bear risk, to the cosigner. In a simple model of peer monitoring in a competitive credit market, this article demonstrates that the transfer of risk to an improvement in borrowers' welfare.}

  abstract = {This article addresses the question of whether institutional frameworks matter in the capital structure of microfinance institutions. We studied a sample of 292 MFIs between 2004 and 2009. Our findings suggest that creditor rights, a country's legal tradition, and the level of financial sector development are significantly related to MFIs' level of external finance. Furthermore, the positive relationship between banking sector development and borrowings enables us to conclude that the microfinance sector and the formal banking sector are complementary. In addition, a split sample technique is used in order to assess the external validity of the model. Findings from this cross-validation strengthen the results obtained from the whole sample and indicate that our model seems to predict well the effect of institutional variables on the capital structure of MFIs.}

The paper then provides a first and preliminary analysis of the concept of the stakeholder society. It investigates whether the managerial incentives and the control structure described in the first part can be modified so as to promote the stakeholder society. It shows that the implementation of the stakeholder society strikes three rocks: dearth of pledgeable income, deadlocks in decision-making, and lack of clear mission for management. While it fares better than the stakeholder society on those three grounds, shareholder value generates biased decision-making; the paper analyzes the costs and benefits of various methods of protecting noncontrolling stakeholders: covenants, exit options, flat claims, enlarged fiduciary duty.},

More clearly, household consumptions are not much influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e., for village-level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages.},

There are multiple theories, these theories can be distinguished in data on repayment rates, and the best-fit theory may vary with the environment.  Finally, the debate about whether to lend to individuals or lend to groups may be misplaced. Under simple theories of selection, the Pareto superior regime, which is predicted to emerge, varies with exogenous environmental characteristics.},

A particularly interesting incentive scheme of this sort has been used by the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh and the author uses this example to motivate some general questions involving group incentive schemes. For example, he shows that a principal prefers a monitor who can reduce the cost of desirable actions rather than increase the cost of undesirable actions. He also considers when it is beneficial to the principal for agents to mutually insure each other. Finally, he examines a sequential incentive plan in which agents form a group and first serve as monitors and later are monitored by other agents.}
